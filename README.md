# Chinese-Game

Implement a fully functional game starting with the selection of the number of players, then the game itself (according to the described rules) assuming that after drawing the number of spots on the dice, the player will decide which pawn he will move.

A numerical value should be given as the field number, assuming that the "start" field with the number 0 is located in the upper right corner of the board - as shown in Figure 1. Include the display of auxiliary field numbers for the next full tens to make it easier for players to determine the numbers of the fields on which their pawns are currently located .
